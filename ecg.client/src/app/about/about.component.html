        <p>
          Tyre retreading is a process of renewing worn-out tyres by applying a new tread, giving them a second life. It
          is a sustainable and economical alternative to buying new tyres, as it reuses the original casing while
          providing new tread patterns for enhanced grip and durability. Retreaded tyres are widely used in commercial
          and fleet vehicles due to their cost-efficiency and reliability.

    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Types of Retreading</h2>

       <!--Conventional or Hot Retreading-->

        <h3>Conventional or Hot Retreading</h3>
        <p>
          Hot retreading, also known as conventional retreading, involves applying a new tread to a tyre using heat and
          pressure. This method is ideal for tyres that undergo heavy usage and need strong adhesion between the new
          tread and the casing. It is a tried-and-tested process that provides a durable and long-lasting solution for
          heavy-duty vehicles.
        </p>
      </div>
       <!--Cold or Precured Retreading--> 
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
        <h3>Cold or Precured Retreading</h3>
        <p>
          Cold retreading, also known as precured retreading, involves bonding a precured tread to the casing without
          the application of heat. This method is preferred for its consistent tread quality and is widely used in
          commercial vehicles. Cold retreading provides superior traction and is more energy-efficient, making it an
          eco-friendly option.
